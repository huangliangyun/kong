Kong plugin template
====================

This repository contains a very simple Kong plugin template to get you
up and running quickly for developing your own plugins.

This template was designed to work with the
[`kong-pongo`](https://github.com/Kong/kong-pongo) and
[`kong-vagrant`](https://github.com/Kong/kong-vagrant) development environments.

Please check out those repos `README` files for usage instructions.
